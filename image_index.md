# Getting started with image templates
{: #getting-started-with-image-templates}

With {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} image templates, you can capture an image of a virtual server to quickly replicate its configuration with minimal changes in the order process.  Before beginning the process, keep in mind that your server will be off-line until the imaging process is complete so be sure to plan for sufficient time for it to complete.  The timing can vary based on a variety of factors including the available resources on the physical host and the amount of data to be copied.
